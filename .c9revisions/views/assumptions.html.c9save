Because this tool aims to put a date\n                        on retirement, all other factors are ignored.  If you aren't saving it for retirement,\n                        you're spending it.\n                    </p>\n                    <label>Market Return</label>\n                    <p>\n                        It is generally accepted that the market will hover around 8% annualized returns.  The S&P 500,\n                        one of the most widely recognized market indexes, has returned\n                        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500#Total_annual_returns\">9.7% yearly</a> over the\n                        last 25 years.  I tend to err on the side of caution, and have used 7% as\n                        the default rate of return from the market.\n                    </p>\n                    <label>Taxes</label>\n                    <p>\n                        Currently for simplicity, tax is only applied to your gross income after your 401k contribution.\n                        Tax is also a flat 15%, which should cover the majority of households.  In the real world, taxes\n                        would be applied to 401k withdrawals, and capital gains from after tax investment accounts.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        There is also an error on the conservative side of the fence, in that income tax isn't actually\n                        flat.  Tax is applied at a graduating rate, so that the last dollar you make is taxed at a \n                        higher rate than the first portion of the money you make.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        See <a href=\"http://goo.gl/3Hf7fY\">here</a> for a table of US income tax rates, and a brief\n                        explanation on how they're applied.\n                    </p>\n                    <label>Social Security</label>\n                    <p>\n                        Currently the tool doesn't factor in any social security or pension plans.

In order to last you\n                        indefinitely, your safe widthrawal rate should be at or below your rate of return - inflation.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study\">Trinity Study</a> was conducted to find\n                        what would have worked historically, and came to the conclusion that generally 4% is a good fit\n                        for a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        If you would like to play with historical withdrawal rates check out \n                        <a href=\"http://www.firecalc.com/\">FIRECalc</a>.
