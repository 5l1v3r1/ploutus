                        It is complicated to handle all of a person's budgeting information, and the billion
                        different aspects of a person's financial situation.  Because this tool aims to put a date
                        on retirement, all other factors are ignored.  If you aren't saving it for retirement,
                        you're spending it.

                        It is generally accepted that the market will hover around 8% annualized returns.  The S&P 500, one of the most
                        widely recognized market indexes, has returned
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500#Total_annual_returns" target="_blank">9.7% yearly</a> over the last
                        25 years.  I tend to err on the side of caution, and have used 7% as the default rate of return from the market.

                        FIRE when ready ignores income tax for retirement accounts, tax is only applied to your gross income after your 401k
                        contribution.  Taxes are based on the graduadated rates of the US federal income tax.

                        Currently FIRE when ready doesn't factor in any social security income or pension plans.  These will greatly
                        affect real world situations.

                A safe withdrawal rate is basically the amount of your portfolio that you can withdraw each
                year, so that you won't run out of money during your lifetime.  In order to last you
                indefinitely, your safe widthrawal rate should be at or below your rate of return minus inflation.

                The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study" target="_blank">Trinity Study</a> was conducted to find
                what would have worked historically, and came to the conclusion that generally 4% (the default value for FIRE when ready) is
                a good fit for a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds.
