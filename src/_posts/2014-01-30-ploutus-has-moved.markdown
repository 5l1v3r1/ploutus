title:  "Ploutus Has Moved!"

If you've visited the site before you'll notice that there have been some changes.  Moving forward, Ploutus will no
longer be a simple retirement  graphing tool.  The plans for the site have expanded to become a small collection of
tools all aimed at helping people understand their future retirement.

One of the changes already implemented is the move away from my previous host.  Ploutus is now hosted on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com) for free.  It was a move that made sense considering GitHub provides support for
everything that Ploutus needs, and it's free to boot.  The free part means Ploutus is more likely to continue on, and
has the added bonus of making my own retirement come that much sooner.

The site has also picked up a lot of optimizations that should help it to run a bit faster as it grows.

Also, I'm hoping you're enjoying the new look as much as I am.
