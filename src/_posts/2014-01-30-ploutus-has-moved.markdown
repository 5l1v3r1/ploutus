If you've visited the site before you'll notice things have changed.  Moving forward, Ploutus will no longer be a simple
financial independence tool.  The plans for the site have expanded to become a collection of tools aimed at helping
people understand financial independence.  In preparation for some of the upcoming changes, a few existing things needed
to change first.

#### I've changed hosts
One of the changes already implemented is the move away from my previous host.  Ploutus is now hosted on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com).  It was a move that made sense considering GitHub provides support for
everything that Ploutus needs, provides excellent uptime, and it's **free**.  The free part means Ploutus is
more likely to survive, and has the added bonus of making my own retirement come that much sooner.

#### Site wide optimizations
While the logic behind the original Ploutus tool (now [FIRE when ready](/fire-when-ready)) wasn't too complicated,
some of the code behind it was bulky.  I've done a lot of work to reduce the size where possible, and the site should
run a bit faster as it grows.

#### New look
You've probably noticed this one.  I'm hoping you're enjoying the new look as much as I am.
